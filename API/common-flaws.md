# common flaws
- **information disclosure** -> *informations that could help exploitation (error, public information: documentation,news,github)*
- **broken object level authorization** -> *ability to access unauthorized resources*
- **broken user authentication** -> *compromise other identities*
- **excessive data exposure** -> *expected response for user A but also includes details for user B*
- **improper rate limiting** -> *bypass rate limiting for DOS, additional cost for provider*
- **broken function level authorization** -> *ability to perform unauthorized actions*
- **mass assignment** -> *ability to modify data that is not supposed to | including isAdmin=True in the registration request url (user=test&password=test&isAdmin=True)*
- **security misconfiguration** -> *developers mistakes that could lead to exploitation | misconfigured headers, lack of encryption, lack of input sanitization, error message*
- **injections** -> *ability to conduct SQLi, NoSQLi, RCE/command injection due to lack of input sanitization*
- **improper asset management** -> *usability of older API version or new API that is still in development | often lack in security as they are not in production*
- **business logic flaws** -> *ability to work around intended functionalities to achieve further exploitation*
